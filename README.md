# interview_prep
This repo is in preparation for an interview I have upcoming at a large payment and transaction company. The position will focus on using machine learning to identify fraud. As a part of the team (25 people distributed across the globe) I would be an individual contributor focused on detecting fraud. The position is 60-70% technical work and 30-40% meeting with stakeholders to understand current business needs. They are looking for someone with a more "sciency" background and can do things like write white-papers. Sounds fun! 

In this repo I am collecting relevant literature on the current space of fraud detection and summarizing those papers. I will also be working with some practice datasets in python.
