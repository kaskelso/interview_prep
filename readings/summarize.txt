Paper #1: Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Realistic Modeling
and a Novel Learning Strategy

Notes: 

Detecting credit card fraud challenges:
1) concept drift (fraud changes over time)
2) class imbalance (far more normal transactions then fraduelent)
3) Verification latencey (delay in verifying fraud because professionals contact suspicious purchases) 

Pipeline for labeled datasets: automatic tools flag suspicious purchases with alerts -> investigator contacts customer confirms or denies purchase -> transaction labled
